To get this working you will need to put your Trac user name and password into the ApplicationConfig class.

The XmlRpcTemplateTest will also fail because of this!

/******** Outstanding tasks *******************************************************************************************/

1. Record user changes to the status of tickets and save these back to Trac
2. Add user selectable milestones (dropdown in UI)
3. Look at caching the results from the Trac XML-RPC calls to improve speed. Might be worth polling for changes?
4. Add a ticket details view (at the very least the links at the top of each ticket should link to Trac)
5. Add the ability to create/delete a new ticket and save this in Trac
6. Login & security
7. Add Avatar pictures for each user  (UI for maintaining?)
8. Error reporting
9. User configurable columns and styles
10. Kanban style work in progress limits for each column

Test coverage needs to be improved drastically!
